# Summary

I needed a 12V battery pack for my LED-strip Arduino project. I'm new to the 3D printing and new to making 3D models. I've found alot online here, but, as I'm very motivated to also build things myself, I decided to create my own model. So here it is, my first 8-AA battery pack.

NOTE: I created a cover too, but it doesn't really fit yet.

There are holes for the wires on each end. Make sure you alternate the batteries to easily put them in serie so you get the 12V. The 12V can be split in parallel to your Arduino and LED-strip. Good luck!
